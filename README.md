<h1><b>Traffic Sign Classification Using CNN
</b><br></h1>
This project is a traffic sign classification system designed to identify 43 distinct traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Built with Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Git, it utilizes the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The model achieved an impressive 93% accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying traffic signs from over 50,000 images.
